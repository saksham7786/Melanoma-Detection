# Melanoma-Detection

Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is a serious health concern with potentially life-threatening consequences if not detected early. With the advancements in deep learning and computer vision, building a CNN-based model has become a promising approach for accurate melanoma detection. In this blog post, we will explore the steps involved in creating a CNN-based model that can effectively identify melanoma, providing a valuable tool for early diagnosis and treatment.


Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
